# Shopizer

These are some brief instructions on how to get Shopizer running on your system. If you prefer a video format, also check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiRreBUFNA) out. The video has some differences to this document but it still may be useful.

## Dependencies

You will need these on your system before running Shopizer.

### Java 8

Ensure you have Java 8 installed and not a later version. Your `%JAVA_HOME%` and `%PATH%` environment variables should also be properly set.

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is a flexible search engine used by Shopizer for search and caching. Install Elasticsearch with all default options by following these [instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html). If you are on Windows, follow the `.zip` instructions not the `.msi` instructions.

## Build

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer
git checkout origin/2.9.0
```

2. Build using Maven (this may take some time)

```
cd <shopizer root>
mvnw clean install
```

On macOs or Linux, use `./mvnw` instead of just `mvnw`.

## Run

1. Ensure Elasticsearch is running

```
cd <elasticsearch install location>/bin
elasticsearch.bat
```

On macOs or Linux, use `./elasticsearch` instead of the `.bat` file.

2. Start Shopizer

```
cd <shopizer root>/sm-shop
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Once Shopizer is running, you can visit `localhost:8080` to view the storefront. You can also visit `localhost:8080/admin` with username `admin@shopizer.com` and password `password` to view the admin panel.

If you ever need 

## Debug

To understand the internals of Shopizer, it may be helpful to step through the code using an IDE.

### InteliJ

*TODO*

### Eclipse

*TODO*

## Other

 - You may notice an interesting exception during the startup of Shopizer. To fix this, search for instances of "DETETE" (there should be three) and change them all to "DELETE".

 - If you ever need to clear all persisted data, delete all `.db` files from inside `sm-shop`, and delete the `data` directory from inside your Elasticsearch install.
